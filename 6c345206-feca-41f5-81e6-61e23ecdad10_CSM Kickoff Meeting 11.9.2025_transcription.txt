This is a meeting for Cyber Security Malaysia on September 11, 2025.  okay for AI server, spec is 512GB. That's the RAM? that just wants to know<|29.98|>  512 he divided to 64 gig one keping so we have 8 more there is another eight can be a maximum 2 terabait of ram the same as 16 has 18 and 4.8 actually okay  Tuan ya<|0.24|><|0.78|> tuan kena bagi tau, tua punya projection<|2.90|><|3.86|> berapa tinggi? mungkin<|5.04|><|5.40|> kemungkinannya yang tuan akan nak break<|6.78|><|7.60|> adakah sampai 1<|8.38|><|8.66|> terabyte atau tak<|9.46|><|10.02|> kalau kata sampai<|10.84|><|11.12|> satu terabyte<|11.64|><|12.12|> means<|12.40|><|13.02|> kita boleh remain pakai 64 gig sekeping<|15.38|><|15.70|> sebab 64 kali dengan 8<|17.58|><|17.88|> kita dapat 512 so maksudnya kalau<|20.52|><|20.54|> 64<|20.94|><|21.86|> kali dengan 16<|22.78|><|22.92|> kita boleh dapat 1024<|26.50|>  2TB of RAM. To maximum if we use 64GB<|3.84|><|6.26|> Is it you want to go up 1TB or not?<|8.34|><|9.96|> Because now I will make 8<|11.70|><|12.34|> Now this is the case for 64<|13.84|><|14.44|> If possible, so that in total us can achieve with 4 slots instead of using 800 all So later 20 more<|22.84|><|24.02|> Yes<|24.60|><|25.06|> But okay<|25.76|><|26.02|> For next one after 64<|28.02|><|28.28|> are 128<|29.98|>  128GB RAM sebatang satu ram ni harga dia tak ingat lah saya kau apa harganya ha? Haa dekat 2000 USD, a keping mahal tu nak tahu adakah Tuan betul-betul ada projection untuk tambah atau tidak kerana the moment kita cross dari 64 pergi kepada 128 lepas 128 terus 256 so 120<|29.28|>  but the kiraan is like this 128GB, we cannot take a chance to have capacity of RAM only. We need to take it as if he has speed. Ram itself has speed his own. So for example now what's our CPU? Epic 32-64 thread so<|21.80|>  I can check it.  Oh, no. No wonder board that requested is Azrok Rek-ROMED8-2T he has 8 slots only but do you have any specific reason for the model of motherboard? The model of Motherboard was not a solution we planned to use AI inference  Oh, if for inference AI actually Uh, do you have a specific reason to use AMD or not? Do you need to wear AMD or can we use Xiong? Intel. Uh, that's us right, it doesn't specify the form of just like okay because here is indeed our SROC ride R-O M E 8 dash go T kan but when there are people looking at this  The motherboard still uses RAM DDR4. Lama now is the DR5 if you look here, he has a speed of 266 that's only 3666 but when we follow our standard nowadays it will be done because  kita bagi dekat sini<|1.06|><|1.34|> GPU<|1.72|><|2.08|> dia sekarang ni generation 5 gen5 punya PCI ok,<|5.64|><|5.90|> gen5<|6.04|><|6.32|> punya PCI<|6.90|><|7.28|> dia punya slot tu adalah bandwidth<|8.98|><|9.72|> 64GB<|9.86|><|11.08|> yang ini<|11.46|><|11.66|> gen 4<|12.46|><|12.78|> gen4<|12.92|><|13.46|> hanya 32GB sahaja bandwidth<|15.50|><|16.16|> so maksud walaupun kita masuk grafik kad tu<|18.36|><|18.96|> Tuan tak boleh fully maximise kan dia punya pembongan<|21.60|><|22.42|> sebab generation motherboard ni adalah<|23.96|><|24.74|> generation yang sebelum ni<|25.98|><|26.70|> RAM dia pun hanya 266<|27.32|><|28.02|> sahaja<|28.28|><|29.14|> okay<|29.98|>  but here I want to do the negotiations for our business, we are actually wanting to talk about it because of that. We can offer later specifications But use Intezion Use Zeon Performance? performance is better if there's a place he has in this area who asks him<|27.84|>  okay, we are like you? maybe I see that because perhaps it is necessary for another discussion to stand the development of this but there will be a effect. Okay what's wrong with me coming in and getting any cost without us changing anything else our application which has been asked about GMPI  we will give mother box jam 5 but not using AMD use Intezion here he asks 32 cork, but how much is it? We do 2 soket. The mistake of the arrangement that has no impact on you can share a small commercial one as per your own yes space-space  I think we,<|5.00|><|6.14|> i am not actually involved in this project.<|8.64|><|9.06|> Cik Hafiz and there are others who have done it? So the expert is a part of what happens to us. This user wants to use AI as software so that's important performance better than if you replace them when they come see quality more high. Definitely low<|29.98|>  Okay, I will give an explanation simple to you. He asked AMD Epic 64 track 32 core can be done here? Nasi semeni kata tuan nanti puas pun boleh cerita dengan team tuan Simple je<|19.00|>  because I see here actually we have stock for the latest gen but it is back so that you are already a loss to your own sebab dah beli DPU tu memang last us bagi jen 5 tapi dia punya model masih jen 4 okay saya explain ya kat sini eh  okay, at this time he asked cpu amd epic 7542 ok that one is not a problem 32 core 60 but you can see here the mother board asrock red rome d8-2t we go to sini  tuan tengok ni eh ROME D8-2T Tuan tengok dekat sini dia punya RAM yang pakai adalah DDR4 and kat sini juga permintaannya ialah memori 512GB 2666 MHz while kita orang ada offering is CPU itu tukar kepada internal  for Intel<|0.42|><|1.00|> instead of 1, 2 CPU<|2.42|><|3.66|> one tu 16-16 so jadi 32 core<|6.20|><|7.38|> Gen 5<|8.38|><|9.34|> RAM dia adalah 4800 MHz<|13.26|><|13.88|> Instead of kat sini 2666<|15.44|><|16.60|> MHz<|16.98|><|17.60|> DDR4<|17.92|><|18.88|> kita bagi 5002 GB<|20.26|><|21.08|> 4800 MHz<|22.36|><|22.82|> DDR5<|23.14|><|24.50|> dekat sini<|25.12|><|26.18|> Dia minta AMD Epic 7542 single GPU<|29.98|>  but we will give it to the mother box that comes with dual CPU. Dual CPU means one of our own CPU is, which can be given model this? We are giving two pieces in here and there's eight more sorry so a  1, 18 Kau bermaksud tuan akan dapat 3.6<|2.00|><|3.18|> kau<|3.46|><|4.26|> extra lagi 4 daripada yang sekarang ni<|6.78|><|7.78|> ha<|7.84|><|9.00|> ini<|9.14|><|9.92|> lepas tu<|10.30|><|11.06|> kalau tengok kat sini bawah ni<|12.56|><|13.38|> nampak tak? DDR5 4800 MT<|18.54|><|18.88|> Ha inilah replacement stick untuk<|20.66|><|21.76|> yang kini<|22.36|><|25.68|> so sebenarnya kat sini pun memang kita bagi at<|27.54|>  and also the latest generation. Because if you use this, we have to break it back here too. We provide is that our PX-6000 will be available with your own partner . This one? GPU. It's most important for us to share in terms of yearning. If I actually want to make a profit, let me wear step on my hand because they are more cheap. But I think<|29.52|>  when you say about to be scalable, the continuity of it I think we are responsible for telling your friend. You can see here spec he is? Look at<|13.00|>  5.0 kalau kita pergi balik ke motherboard tadi tu<|4.92|><|6.76|> dia punya PCIe adalah nampak kan?<|8.36|><|8.84|> PCIe<|9.42|><|9.74|> gen 4 Haa,<|11.42|><|12.24|> so<|12.32|><|12.84|> perbezaan<|13.54|><|14.40|> Gen 4 difference<|16.28|><|17.06|> between<|17.74|><|18.42|> Gen 4 and<|19.50|><|19.98|> Gen 5<|20.78|><|22.66|> Gen 4<|22.94|><|23.18|> adalah 32GB<|24.16|><|24.46|> Gen 5<|24.80|><|25.14|> adalah<|25.44|><|26.54|> 64GB<|27.46|>  so, Gen 4 TCIE 16 lane  4th leg gen 42GB. PCIe 16th leg<|5.74|><|6.24|> Gen 5 is 64GB<|8.24|><|9.32|> So,<|9.38|><|9.68|> walaupun lah<|10.40|><|10.80|> kalau katalah kita pakai spec yang sedia ada<|12.58|><|13.74|> Kita bagi dekat tuan<|14.78|><|15.38|> GPU yang ni<|16.10|><|16.72|> Tuan takkan boleh maximize the full bandwidth<|18.80|><|19.96|> Sebab matobot tu masih lagi Gen 4 Jadi dekat sini kita punya offering<|25.04|><|25.34|> adalah untuk bagi ke atas tuan<|26.64|><|27.00|> Gen 5<|29.98|>  because they are completely different, one generation at the top. From a technical perspective like this so it is already here and then often that's what you want to do I really like if there can be accepted but from an angle of change all over time when we don't know how much as well  Maksudnya dah dapat, dah kick off dan kita submit lah. Setujuan you all berdua. So the syarat dia kena hire. Ha betul boleh kan? Kalau lower tak boleh kan, ia melibatkan<|9.00|><|9.30|> murah harga pula tak boleh. Maknanya<|11.32|><|12.12|> Kita nak KULOA based on... Based on lama<|14.42|><|14.88|> Spesak lama. Award yang lama nanti mesti Kickoff akan keluar PO<|19.14|><|19.18|> Nanti PO akan<|19.82|><|20.06|> base on<|20.44|><|20.70|> Kickoff punya<|21.22|>  there is a spec, there are two. So we can change the back to something like this? Right Once you have cut off it means that I agree now our LOA based on long-term and then cancel later whether they will accept or not so if currently us do what's going on today but instead of being done in fact as well<|29.98|>  because for<|4.24|><|4.92|> if you do now, maybe there is a little long story. I don't know the CSM side but in other places he told him to remove SST based on<|12.62|><|13.14|> steps that has it<|13.76|><|14.42|> But during kick off we will appeal about spesifikation which exists are slightly burning so we suggest going this one<|21.96|>  Okay, LOE is there? If we have the process of what I want to go out with LOA that first We can't change it. That's why we will leave because later you don't need a red ticket for us who call police but normally when kick off meeting<|17.28|><|18.00|> we'll set up in minute meetings and then put on new spec along with brochure after he won' t compound into contract document or continue changing now<|28.56|>  but, inilah we are going to the next because if you go legal I say that our job is valid. Legal will see most of us who do it and they will be put on LA which one we show . If this person's fear usually then other people'll question back But when can please work? Oh your wants with KDN A does not want for them at all ?  if we change the spec, they will know that. But when we look back here, Dila point out is indeed valid for us to give it a new year during this negotiation so there are no need in our own because of which we really answer minimum means that we can provide minimal but when you see them I'll be more and less than enough<|25.36|>  that we use LOA and the agreement for payment. So, it must be with someone who is not... Right? We all agree just to do this one-the -mortem E lah. This will go on here in a way. That's right. It means there are people need control before you follow me. Oh Cik Sharon Rady or something like him too can also make an end but I have position at first of us<|27.66|>  Just addendum to the boss. Later, now we do it with Mimos. Same lah. Okay same. We have a spec and some kids. He has an agenda. Like this ah. So kita akan buat besoknya ni<|17.06|><|17.64|> dengan harga sekian tu lepas tu nanti kick off<|19.96|><|20.32|> will release surat dari pihak<|21.68|><|22.44|> from that minute<|22.92|><|22.96|> he is in need for me too<|23.52|>  there is a certain by the user from here we will remove letters for what he calls, this is that it's not as long as possible. He has called LOA supplementary to him later and then I want water after one so you can call loa supplementary they are supplements at his own<|29.28|>  I see. Okay? In the case, it's okay. It is better like that because you want to make an inference . So sometimes when your kick off has made a set of proposals and then we will do this in advance so during the break there was no positive for me or not. We can highlight points-points why are they getting more than what people who have done them?  we will do side by side with the prison then, so that's how it is. So you have to mention there are no effects or what? Cost of cost That can be important because when we look at this thing I know actually things like an AI server for training 70 billion kilometer in front too  this, eh. If you look here, it's a Nvidia L40<|2.94|><|3.46|> I just want to show that one<|6.00|>  this is also Gen 4 so that's what we see uh, it must be seen on the spec but you have to comply first whatever complies before if I complain about my time when they come and then actually  So, now we will go out and there is a result. Then it's okay to make one table in the room with letters .<|18.56|>  If we have a meeting, one month. We are making proposals for the first time of this. This is an acceptance part? Yes. For other parts it doesn't matter either. Other things okay. Then let's give you another application to below that person. It will be more than before then. How about earlier in store OS too? That was all I wanted.  So, you use desktop Windows or using Ubuntu? Linux style. Linup? Ah Ubuntu okay? Umbu 2 yes. Can do it so this application is web based on the application website actually OK show new skill now and not have time already for us technically that's all point there are more things to be done because of some other thing I need a little bit too  I have seen that we are the payment warranty for 3 years, but 5 years. Is it three or five? We really gave a hardware guarantee in 5 years. Five year of 4-5 years. Three is $3,500. This one was asked to be 1/2 . And then there were applications also added.<|29.98|>  okay, here is the warranty 5 years. I have SLA? Okay, in this case we will highlight it too at Pertapan Warrant on hardware . On hardware are five days from acceptance right ? From date our UAT or EAT , let's go back to where there was a place  Okay, it's so right. This is not 5 years including this one . I want to know the warranty cover for maintenance? The warranty covers with hardware if there are a hardware that has been damaged within five years we will replace but he does no support in site because here we really give you 1-1  setahun eh ni? Minta pun setahun,<|3.78|><|4.52|> kita bagi pun setahun. Haa.. maksudnya waranti lima tahun nak buat kalau ada apa-apa aa... impact ke problem ke<|12.46|><|12.82|> you all akan inilah dah dapat Ya tapi dia bukan on site<|15.62|><|15.88|> Dia bukan onsite<|16.52|><|16.56|> haaa bermaksud okey saya bagi Saya bagi clear terus sekarang ni Bermaksud<|19.90|><|20.36|> Kalau dekat sini<|21.00|><|21.78|> Must provide technical onside support letter equipment for period of one year<|25.76|><|26.62|> Lapan hours sekali 5 hari seminggu<|28.48|>  Bermaksud,<|0.50|><|1.06|> dari date kita hand over kat tuan. 12 bulan ke depan<|4.96|><|5.56|> any problem<|6.26|><|7.20|> dalam masa 8 jam<|8.70|><|10.00|> sorry, dalam masa<|10.78|><|11.22|> satu tahun ni<|11.76|><|11.78|> 8<|12.00|><|12.72|> jam sehari 5 hari seminggu<|14.16|><|15.00|> Tuan ada program<|15.60|><|16.12|> Kita akan attend<|16.72|><|17.76|> Tapi selepas setahun<|19.02|><|19.62|> support ni dah takde<|20.50|><|21.18|> Yang ada adalah hardware warranty sahaja Tuanku bagi tau orang kita<|24.42|><|25.10|> GPU rosak<|25.74|><|26.82|> Kitorang akan replace kan GPU sahaja kat tuan<|28.94|>  apa berlaku kat tempat lain dah,<|1.28|><|1.64|> selepas sebelum habis satu tahun tempoh<|4.18|><|4.72|> support ni<|5.12|><|5.90|> dia akan renew maintenance contract ataupun renew support sahaja.<|9.50|><|10.14|> Tak perlu renew lagi on the extended warranty of the hardware<|12.86|><|13.64|> Dah cover? Yang<|15.08|><|15.22|> renew adalah<|15.88|><|16.98|> onsite support<|17.52|><|17.78|> Onside support maksud<|18.64|><|19.38|> Maintenance<|19.94|><|20.66|> and onsite support Betul<|21.82|><|22.04|> So sekarang ni yang ni<|23.02|><|23.74|> maintainer<|24.32|><|24.52|> and onsite support<|25.48|><|26.14|> setahun saja<|26.84|><|27.86|> Dalam lima tahun tu<|28.84|>  So, what do you mean? The price in this is included. If it wants to maintain again for the second year there will be RM on-site support . How many guarantees are still maintained ? if not taking outside supports that so when he comes and does charge him from your time or whether who opens up his own hand<|29.98|>  We, we will get it. It is like a handphone lah. Like the car. Kita have to take at service center as well. Contoh of that too. When you do one je, our people come here and there are cover so he has maintenance who does preventive or prevention with<|29.98|>  I don't mention it. In the year, he has a message but we can do that in one of them? But if you want to enter once again... Because at our LOA later we need something like this  This is basically we are out of outside<|3.50|><|4.64|> SOC. So, in this<|6.46|><|6.96|> they mention on-site support<|8.42|><|8.82|> if you have a problem<|9.78|><|10.18|> then it will be available to come<|11.10|><|11.74|> but what Puan said was preventive maintenance<|14.04|><|14.60|> permanent repair that<|15.48|><|16.02|> our people today<|17.00|><|17.50|> We would give once<|18.40|><|19.42|> means can choose whether after 6 months or<|22.30|><|23.34|> the end<|24.24|><|24.26|> penghujung before finishing<|26.04|><|26.68|> do one time<|27.76|>  So, the user has one to decide call. We can check it first. Once a time? But when that is ? Decide by users but we advise not paying for you . Wait until end. How do we make in our own place? One day once again. One year after another. One month ago. One week before yesterday was made at home and then he had already done with him. The same thing happened earlier on his way of getting married from being treated as well.  What is the maintenance? Preventive maintenance PM lah, kan? Haa pm Yang tadi tu yang on set support basically corrective maintenance Oh what ? Corrective maintenance Ya ada masalah panggil Pening of a year apa ni preventive pun satu tahun Sekali sekali sehari sekaligus kerana itu kali boleh memilih pengguna boleh memilih user define la<|29.98|>  when? When to do it. A year from our salary rate, UAP is 100% developed by local . It's interesting that the app has something useful later we will show you or not maybe a target of three but this may be focused on two  so the hardware one is included, this item other items too. switcher eh? switchers actually I already checked it earlier if possible we have confirmed that our time should continue to enter order . That's what I can't control because when they change model or something later then will be difficult once we set up and go out of LWN we keep going lock orders first  the other thing is all, it's okay in a long time of what? so that you need to hurry up and then go ahead. So LOA enough! LoA enough! tak payah pick off lagi pun tak apa. Let us keep going for LOA order first lock barang tu dulu haa ni lah maksudnya item 2 sampai 5 eh daripada your view yang ada masalah ya dan dia tidak mempunyai but dari segi network ini tiap-you juga sebab okey je la<|29.98|>  What is the scope? The scope of it wants to know, he has 5 years. It's already a warranty for five years too right ? This really means that this one was also an inventory from kilang . So same as our offering in 1-1 year or something we delivered , what happened at first time I had on site and then got stuck<|29.98|>  Okay, warranty from the manufacturer 5 years. Support is 1 year? So that this one doesn't have a material right? Nah it's not an item yet. Just like which ini has to ask for configuration once ke? This one does no need to request confirmation kan? so I want to know about what we will do later in our next time and then let us supply<|28.16|>  there is a complication. If not, the state in it will be done by taking work team here who would do? Because of habit we have part that even if you ask for us to confirm, actually we need to change too<|29.98|>  with team network CSM because we don't know protocol, even though it's like that. That is the normal standard of work and our network can not be able to help you do okay? Okay so this will give in 4-4 for a week right ? For an order huh?<|27.28|>  4 weeks? No problem. Because, for the next to get off you need document untuk perubahan it with a regular schedule so that there is any format before getting out of we want them to do something like this . What does they have in order if not yet or otherwise when going on our start will be done ? what are those who can make up and then go ahead?  but there is a portion of the acceptance. We do it, so we have to refer you for information like that too? But they must be in position two people who are already available and also one person has an option - both- Both sides .  later, we will confirm the first time before that print it can be done okay? so very forward after kick off meeting eh lepas tu jop was a team support please give me  Oh, LAD. I just want to add it up. There is a delivery penalty . Ah, LAD okay? Just like that with the alat. We usually have 1% standard per day from total. 4 million more than this ? 5 thousand. Okay? But we can talk about what they are doing too much but there's no choice of them or not even if you don't do anything either.  I actually on the server side, there is no problem. We have ready stock of all items and just need to end sample at 10th time that I don't worry about it but we ordered with someone else because he was in a way from where? From when came him didn't know how did you come? But we order for some people here<|29.98|>  but he came to China. This is what you said, BRS? We have a parent in this place . He pointed out your eyes as the final point of his child. It's that it was Pysen. Oh, here I am from my side who...  from CSM, what? Norman<|5.82|><|7.42|> he doesn't have a key off. So need to do NDA or not there is sharing<|15.44|>  We deliver it, we can send to the other place. Then just sent at a server room or that's what you have? The one who will be in front of your side is not available for extra purposes right?  so we proceed to commercial for the price okay there is no one, right? not a lot of things. Is it something that has us left or was missing in our place ? No because he's very safe forward . The most practical thing actually specifically and those who are likely I like Okay So process will be commercial again then also go out on this point , $349-521.48 eh termasuk 8%<|29.98|>  there is a service Oh yeah, but the main thing that has it was so we gave services. That's right? The one who had to do something like this and then he said I have an extra for you too. But they made them more than anything about what happened in my opinion of mine.  supply, but in the spec there is a service. If we buy hardware and then have modified it too, already has an issue like that .<|21.12|>  okay so, like this? there is a reason why you said earlier about the upgrade or that it has to spend. can but if I want to do something else . There are ways for reducing them too ? Yes , yes 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊 啊  3, 2, 3. Buatkan satu service Kata 30 ribu servis So nanti Dekat servis tadi Boleh? Haa Jadi you all kena keluarkan anda Mereka nak peretauan harga aa Bila kita boleh Peretau kan bagian tu Kita di sini beri-diri saiz sekarang terus je Adakah Nak submit belik kat Puan sekarang ke macam mana ni Nanti summit tu ada dengan Ada lain dokumen Sabit pun<|29.98|>  we can do a new box, put it in the next one. We have to reduce as possible . Okay if like that before going there actually from CSM has certain number which needs to be achieved<|29.98|>  can share terus direct, tell us how much is the amount of money that you need. Or what do we take SST? Then let's see like a moment to move on there and it will be done in order for now I saw earlier at this time when he was already around with him so far before his brother had been made up by himself but also about making an example from getting more than just another one-time person who got married then did not get into your own or something else because even though they were doing nothing wrong yet<|29.98|>  8% is only 50,000. I think one box right?
